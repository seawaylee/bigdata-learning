Nowadays, going to gym after work is most peopleâ€™s choice, because they need to be keep fit.
The young blue and white collar sit in their offices all the daytime and they lack of exercise,
most of them are in the sub-health state.
They realize the importance of taking exercise and more gyms have been opened to meet their needs.
In my opinion, we can not only exercise our body, but also to have fun.
The gym provides people a place to make friends.
They can find someone who has the same interest with them, and then just talk to them.
They can forget about the annoyance and just relax themselves.
Some girls like to do yoga while some boys like to play badmiton.
They can choose whatever they like, which is good for keeping good mood.
