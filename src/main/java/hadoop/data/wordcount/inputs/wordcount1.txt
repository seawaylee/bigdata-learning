Research on Distributed Recommendation Model Based on Cooperative Filtering and Naive Bayesian
Abstract: Collaborative filtering is a more mature one in the recommended algorithm. Aiming at the bottleneck problem of processing speed and computational resources faced by traditional matrix decomposition algorithm in dealing with massive data information, the parallel decomposition algorithm of matrix decomposition under Spark framework is proposed by using Spark's advantages in memory computation and iterative calculation. In the original data set, some of the data are missing the necessary features, so the naive Bayesian classifier for the book review is constructed to carry on the emotion analysis to the Chinese text in order to achieve the more ideal recommendation effect. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm based on collaborative filtering and the Chinese emotional classifier based on naive Bayesian algorithm can be combined efficiently in distributed environment to achieve the desired recommendation effect.
